# Stata_sandbox
# Stata Snippets and Scripts

This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous Stata (.do) files for mapping.  These scripts are primarily for my personal use, learning, and experimentation with Stata, and are shared as a resource for others who might find them helpful or want to see examples of different Stata techniques. Use at your own risk!

## Description

This repo serves as a central location for Stata code snippets, scripts, and small programs.  The code here covers a variety of topics and may not always be fully polished or documented.  Think of it as a digital notebook for my Stata explorations.

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders (where appropriate) to group related scripts.  However, many scripts may be directly in the main directory.  Here's a general overview:

* **FL_county_maps: Contains scripts related to mapping the change in the volume of foreign investment in Florida real estate over time by county.
* **README.md: This file.
